This repository is mainly dedicated for listing the recent research advancements in the application of Self-Supervised-Learning in medical images computing field. Inspired by [awesome-self-supervised-learning](https://github.com/jason718/awesome-self-supervised-learning)



#### What is self-supervised learning?

Self-Supervised learning (SSL) is a hybrid learning approach that combines both supervised and unsupervised learning simultaneously. More clearly, SSL is an approach that aims at learning semantically useful features for a certain task by generating supervisory signal from a pool of unlabeled data without the need for human annotation. These representations is then used for subsequent tasks where the amount of labeled data is limited.

#### Why Self-Supervised learning in medical imaging ?

* Unlabeled medical imaging data is a abundant, but human annotated data is scarce.
* building a large enough human annotated medical imaging datasets is:
  1.  Expensive.
  2. Time consuming.
  3. Requires experienced personnel.
  4. Prone to patients’ privacy preserving issues.
